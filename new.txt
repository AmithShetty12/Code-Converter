Code Logic:

The code simulates the game of Tic Tac Toe. It starts by creating a 3x3 board represented by a list of lists, where each element is a string representing the position on the board. The player's current mark ('X' or 'O') is tracked, and the game loop continues until a winner is declared or the game ends in a draw.

Approach to Convert to Python:

1. Import the necessary modules: `sys` for exiting the game, and `copy` for creating a deep copy of the board for evaluation.

2. Create a function `display_board(board)` to print the current board state.

3. Implement the `check_win(board, player_mark)` function to evaluate the board for a winning condition.

4. Create a `check_draw(board)` function to check if the game has ended in a draw.

5. Implement the `switch_player(current_player)` function to switch the current player's mark.

6. Define a function `convert_position(position)` to convert the user's input position to row and column indices.

7. Write the `main()` function as the game loop, handling user input, board updates, and game state evaluation.

Python Code:


python
import sys
import copy

def display_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" | ".join(row))
        print("-" * 5)

def check_win(board, player_mark):
    for row in board:
        if all(cell == player_mark for cell in row):
            return True
    for col in range(3):
        if all(board[row][col] == player_mark for row in range(3)):
            return True
    if all(board[i][i] == player_mark for i in range(3)):
        return True
    if all(board[i][2 - i] == player_mark for i in range(3)):
        return True
    return False

def check_draw(board):
    return all(cell.isdigit() for row in board for cell in row)

def switch_player(current_player):
    return "O" if current_player == "X" else "X"

def convert_position(position):
    return (position - 1) // 3, (position - 1) % 3

def main():
    board = [["1", "2", "3"], ["4", "5", "6"], ["7", "8", "9"]]
    current_player = "X"
    game_over = False

    print("Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!")
    display_board(board)

    while not game_over:
        position = int(input(f"Player {current_player} turn. Enter a position (1-9): "))
        row, col = convert_position(position)

        if board[row][col].isdigit():
            board[row][col] = current_player
            display_board(board)

            if check_win(board, current_player):
                print(f"Game over. Player {current_player} wins!")
                game_over = True
            elif check_draw(board):
                print("Game over. It's a draw!")
                game_over = True
            else:
                current_player = switch_player(current_player)
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")

    sys.exit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
