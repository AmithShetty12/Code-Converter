Sure, I can help you review the COBOL logic flow and approach, as well as provide some Python code that follows a similar logic:


cobol
* Declare data structures and variables for storing product, warehouse, and order information, along with general-purpose variables for calculations and error handling.
01  PRODUCT-TABLE.
      05  PRODUCT-ID                   PIC X(5).
      05  PRODUCT-NAME                 PIC X(20).
      05  PRODUCT-PRICE                PIC 9(6)V99.
      05  PRODUCT-LOCATION             PIC X(10).
      01  WAREHOUSE-TABLE.
      05  WAREHOUSE-ID                 PIC X(5).
      05  WAREHOUSE-NAME               PIC X(20).
      05  WAREHOUSE-LOCATION           PIC X(10).
      01  ORDER-TABLE.
      05  ORDER-ID                     PIC X(5).
      05  ORDER-PRODUCT-ID            PIC X(5).
      05  ORDER-QUANTITY               PIC 9(6).
      05  ORDER-DATE                   PIC X(8).
      05  ORDER-STATUS                 PIC X.
* Initialize data with default values, such as setting product prices and warehouse locations.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    PERFORM INITIALIZE-DATA.




python
# Declare data structures and variables for storing product, warehouse, and order information, along with general-purpose variables for calculations and error handling.
product_table = []
warehouse_table = []
order_table = []

# Initialize data with default values, such as setting product prices and warehouse locations.
def initialize_data():
    # Initialize product table
    product = {
        "PRODUCT-ID": "P001",
        "PRODUCT-NAME": "Product 1",
        "PRODUCT-PRICE": 10.00,
        "PRODUCT-LOCATION": "Warehouse A"
    }
    product_table.append(product)

    # Initialize warehouse table
    warehouse = {
        "WAREHOUSE-ID": "W001",
        "WAREHOUSE-NAME": "Warehouse A",
        "WAREHOUSE-LOCATION": "123 Main Street"
    }
    warehouse_table.append(warehouse)




cobol
* Read the next order record from storage.
01  NEXT-ORDER                  PIC X(80).
...
      READ FILE ORDER-FILE
            INTO NEXT-ORDER
            AT END MOVE SPACES TO NEXT-ORDER.




python
# Read the next order record from storage.
def read_next_order():
    # Assuming we have a file called "orders.txt" containing order records
    # with the format: "ORDER-ID,ORDER-PRODUCT-ID,ORDER-QUANTITY,ORDER-DATE"
    with open("orders.txt", "r") as f:
        next_order = f.readline()
        return next_order




cobol
* Validate the order:
    * Check if the product ID in the order is valid.
    * Check if the order quantity is valid.
    * Check if the order date is valid.
* If any validation fails, mark the order as invalid and continue to the next order.
...
      IF NEXT-ORDER NOT = SPACES
         PERFORM VALIDATE-ORDER
         IF NOT ORDER-VALID
            MOVE "INVALID" TO ORDER-STATUS
         ELSE
            MOVE "VALID" TO ORDER-STATUS
      ELSE
         EXIT




python
# Validate the order. Check if the product ID in the order is valid.
# Check if the order quantity is valid. Check if the order date is valid.
# If any validation fails, mark the order as invalid and continue to the next order.
def validate_order(order):
    order_id, product_id, quantity, date = order.split(",")

    # Check if the product ID is valid
    if product_id not in [product["PRODUCT-ID"] for product in product_table]:
        return False

    # Check if the order quantity is valid
    if int(quantity) <= 0:
        return False

    # Check if the order date is valid
    # Assuming a valid date format is YYYYMMDD
    if not date.isdigit() or len(date) != 8:
        return False

    return True




cobol
* Otherwise, calculate the total order amount by multiplying the order quantity by the product price.
* Update the total order amount and the count of valid orders.
...
         MULTIPLY ORDER-QUANTITY BY PRODUCT-PRICE GIVING ORDER-AMOUNT
         ADD ORDER-AMOUNT TO TOTAL-ORDER-AMOUNT
         ADD 1 TO VALID-ORDER-COUNT




python
# Calculate the total order amount by multiplying the order quantity by the product price.
# Update the total order amount and the count of valid orders.
def calculate_order_amount(order):
    order_id, product_id, quantity, date = order.split(",")

    # Get the product price
    product_price = [product["PRODUCT-PRICE"] for product in product_table if product["PRODUCT-ID"] == product_id][0]

    # Calculate the total order amount
    order_amount = int(quantity) * product_price

    # Update the total order amount and the count of valid orders
    total_order_amount += order_amount
    valid_order_count += 1




cobol
* After processing all orders, generate a report that includes product information, order details, and calculated totals.
* The report is generated line by line, where each line contains information about a specific order.
* The report includes product ID, product name, order quantity, order date, total order amount, and any errors encountered while processing the order.
...
      PERFORM GENERATE-REPORT




python
# After processing all orders, generate a report that includes product information, order details, and calculated totals.
def generate_report():
    # Generate a report header
    report_header = "Product ID | Product Name | Order Quantity | Order Date | Total Order Amount | Order Status"
    print(report_header)

    # Generate a report line for each valid order
    for order in order_table:
        if order["ORDER-STATUS"] == "VALID":
            product_id = order["ORDER-PRODUCT-ID"]
            product_name = [product["PRODUCT-NAME"] for product in product_table if product["PRODUCT-ID"] == product_id][0]
